# Blockchain-Based Specialized Collectible Card Authentication (BSCCA)

## Overview

The Blockchain-Based Specialized Collectible Card Authentication (BSCCA) system provides a decentralized solution for verifying, registering, and tracking collectible cards. By leveraging blockchain technology, BSCCA creates an immutable record of card authenticity, condition, and ownership history, addressing counterfeit concerns and establishing trust in the collectible card market.

## Core Components

### Manufacturer Verification Contract
Validates authorized card producers through cryptographic proof, establishing a trustworthy foundation for card authenticity. Only verified manufacturers can register new card series on the platform.

### Card Registration Contract
Records essential details of rare or valuable cards including set information, rarity, edition numbers, distinctive features, and authentication markers. Each card receives a unique identifier on the blockchain.

### Grading Certification Contract
Documents professional condition assessments with standardized criteria, creating verifiable records of card quality that can be referenced during transactions.

### Ownership Transfer Contract
Tracks the complete chain of custody for each registered card, documenting every change in possession while maintaining privacy options for collectors.
